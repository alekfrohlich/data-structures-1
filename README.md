# data-structures

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/matheuspb/data-structures.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/matheuspb/data-structures)

Data structures implemented for my data structures course (INE5408) at UFSC.

* Linear structures:
	* [Stack](include/stack.h)
	* [Queue](include/queue.h)
	* [Array list](include/array_list.h)
	* [Linked list](include/linked_list.h)
	* [Doubly circular list](include/doubly_circular_list.h)
* Tree structures:
	* [Binary search tree](include/binary_tree.h)
	* [AVL tree](include/avl_tree.h)
	* [Red-Black tree](include/rb_tree.h)
* Other structures:
	* [Hash table](include/hash_table.h)
	* [Heap](include/heap.h)

[Floyd algorithm complexity analysis](floyd.tex)

Documentations for all classes can be generated using
[doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/). All classes use the C++11
standard.

Note: if someone is interested in the solutions that I handed in the course,
one should look back at commit 07d4884ee465d0666608ae7283801c292582d417 and
those header files should work fine. If you have any problems using them, feel
free to contact me at telegram.me/matheuspb.
